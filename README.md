# Intel Project

---

This is the repository for the Intel project! Here's the broad file structure:

```
data
	- data.json (the full data)
workspace
	- any individual files/tests
scraper.py (the core scraper module)
aggregate.py (for pulling data)
dashboard.py (the dash application)
test_data.py (test suite for the scraped data)
```

Make sure you communicate clearly about who is working on what file. It might be helpful, as least in the beginning, to push to things to the workspace folder.
