Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (NYSE: \\nSMI; SEHK: 981) (“SMIC” or the “Company”), one of the leading semiconductor foundries in the world, \\ntoday announced its consolidated results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2009.   \\n \\nSecond Quarter 2009 Highlights: \\n \\n(cid:1)  Revenue up by 82.5% to $267.4 million from $146.5 million in 1Q09 and down by 22.0% \\ncompared to 2Q08.  Specifically, advanced logic sales from 0.13 micron and 90 \\nnanometer nodes have significantly increased by 135.3% quarter-over-quarter in the \\nsecond quarter of 2009. \\n(cid:1)  Gross margins improved to -4.8% in 2Q09 compared to -88.3% in 1Q09 due to a \\nsignificant increase in wafer shipments and fab utilization. \\n(cid:1)  Loss attributable to holders of ordinary shares of $98.1 million in 2Q09, compared to a \\nloss of $178.3 million in 1Q09.  \\n(cid:1)  Fully diluted EPS was ($0.2196) per ADS. \\n \\nThird Quarter 2009 Guidance: \\n \\n  The following statements are forward looking statements which are based on current \\nexpectation and which involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are set forth under “Safe Harbor \\nStatements” below. \\n \\n(cid:1)  Revenue is expected to increase 14% to 18% QoQ. \\n(cid:1)  Operating expenses excluding foreign exchange difference are expected to range from $90 \\nmillion to $93 million. \\n(cid:1)  Capital expenditures expected to range from $60 million to $65 million. \\n(cid:1)  Depreciation and amortization expected to be around $199 million to $201 million. \\n \\n \\nCommenting on the quarterly results, Dr. Richard Chang, Chief Executive Officer of SMIC, remarked, \\n“In the second quarter of 2009, we witnessed strong business recovery on all fronts. Total revenue \\nincreased 82.5% quarter-over-quarter, exceeding our originally stated guidance.  Our utilization rate \\nincreased to 75% in the second quarter as our logic shipments increased by 102% quarter-over-\\nquarter.  Advanced logic revenue for 0.13-micron and below grew by more than 135% from the first \\nquarter of 2009, increasing to 41% as a portion of total revenue from 32% in the first quarter.  This \\nsignificant recovery was driven largely by our customers’ strong performances in the communications \\nand consumer segments.  Our book-to-bill ratio has been greater than one in the past five \\nconsecutive months and new tape outs in the second quarter reached a record high for the last six \\nquarters and are up 58.5% from the first quarter of 2009, preliminarily indicating a sustained recovery. \\n  - 1 -  \\n \\n \\nSecond quarter recovery was fueled by recovered customer demand across all regions and robust \\nend demand in Asian markets.  Regionally, our Greater China revenue in the second quarter \\nincreased by 87.4%, and North America revenue increased by 85.3% quarter-over-quarter.  We also \\nsaw a healthy increase in our Europe sales this quarter. \\n \\nIn terms of advanced technology development, we have already commenced risk production on our \\n65nm low-power process in the beginning of the third quarter.  In addition, our 45nm low-power \\ntechnology qualification process is on schedule with products from multiple customers under \\ndevelopment, and we plan to pass full-scale technology qualification by the fourth quarter of 2009.  \\nMoreover, we have achieved successful completion of our first 45nm high performance GP yield lot, \\nenabling us to further serve our customers with competitive advanced technology.  Moving forward, \\nwe are confident that our continual efforts to strengthen our technology and overall product mix will \\nlead us to a better position for profitability. \\n  \\nWe have maintained a positive EBITDA margin throughout this global economic cyclical downturn.  \\nWe have also continued to exercise tight control over capital expenditures and enhance our financial \\nposition.   For the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, we have spent in total $44.9 million on \\ncapital expenditures while for the same period, we have generated $121.3 million net cash from \\noperations.  Our $190 million annual capital expenditure budget is unchanged.  With tight discipline \\nover capital expenditures, we forecast that total depreciation and amortization expense will decline \\naround 13% year-on-year in 2010.   \\n \\nAs our customer orders remain strong, we see current momentum for recovery to continue in the third \\nquarter with double-digit revenue growth over the second quarter of 2009.  We remain vigilant on our \\ncost controls and continue to focus on enhancing our product portfolio, and commit to strengthening \\nour operational and financial performances on all fronts as we strive toward our goal of achieving \\nprofitability.” \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nConference Call / Webcast Announcement \\n \\nDate: July 29, 2009 \\nTime: 8:00 a.m. Shanghai time \\nDial-in numbers and pass code: U.S. 1-617-614-3672 / 1-800-260-8140 or HK 852-3002-1672 (Pass \\ncode: SMIC).   \\n \\nA live webcast of the 2009 second quarter announcement will be available at http://www.smics.com \\nunder the “Investor Relations” section.

TSMC seeks, among other things, \\ndamages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, and the acceleration of the remaining payments \\noutstanding under that settlement agreement. \\n \\nIn the present litigation, TSMC alleges that the Company has incorporated TSMC trade secrets in the \\nmanufacture of the Company’s 0.13 micron or smaller process products. TSMC further alleges that as \\na result of this claimed breach, TSMC’s  patent license is terminated and the covenant not to sue is \\nno longer in effect with respect to the Company’s larger process products. The Company has \\nvigorously denied all allegations of misappropriation. The Court has made no finding that TSMC’s \\nclaims are valid. The Court has set a trial date of September 8, 2009. \\n \\nOn September 13, 2006, the Company announced that in addition to filing a response strongly \\ndenying the allegations of TSMC in the United States lawsuit, it filed on September 12, 2006, a cross-\\ncomplaint against TSMC seeking, among other things, damages for TSMC’s breach of contract and \\nbreach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \\n \\nOn November 16, 2006, the High Court in Beijing, the People’s Republic of China, accepted the filing \\nof a complaint by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely, SMIC (Shanghai) and \\nSMIC (Beijing), regarding the unfair competition arising from the breach of bona fide (i.e. integrity, \\ngood faith) principle and commercial defamation by TSMC (“PRC Complaint”). In the PRC Complaint, \\nthe Company is seeking, among other things, an injunction to stop TSMC’s infringing acts, public \\napology from TSMC to the Company and compensation from TSMC to the Company, including profits \\ngained by TSMC from their infringing acts. \\n \\nOn August 14, 2007, the Company filed an amended cross-complaint against TSMC seeking, among \\nother things, damages for TSMC’s breach of contract and breach of patent license agreement. TSMC \\nthereafter denied the allegations of the Company’s amended cross-complaint and subsequently filed \\nadditional claims that the Company breached a settlement agreement by filing an action in the Beijing \\nHigh Court. The Company has denied these additional claims by TSMC. \\n \\nOn August 15-17, 2007, the California Court held a preliminary injunction hearing on TSMC’s motion \\nto enjoin use of certain process recipes in certain of the Company’s 0.13 micron logic process flows. \\nOn September 7, 2007, the Court denied TSMC’s preliminary injunction motion, thereby leaving \\nunaffected the Company’s development and sales. However, the court required the Company to \\nprovide 10 days’ advance notice to TSMC if the Company plans to disclose logic technology to non-\\nSMIC entities under certain circumstances, to allow TSMC to object to the planned disclosure. \\n \\nIn May 2008, TSMC filed a motion in the California Court for summary adjudication against the \\nCompany on several of the Company’s cross claims. The Company opposed the motion and on \\nAugust 6, 2008, the Court granted in part and denied in part TSMC’s motion. \\n \\nOn June 23, 2008, the Company filed in the California court a cross-complaint against TSMC seeking, \\namong other things, damages for TSMC’s unlawful misappropriation of trade secrets from SMIC to \\nimprove its competitive position against SMIC. \\n \\nOn July 10, 2008, the California Court held a preliminary injunction hearing on TSMC’s motion to \\nenjoin disclosure of information on certain process recipes in the Company’s 0.30 micron logic \\nprocess flows to 3rd parties. On August 8, 2008, the Court granted-in-part TSMC’s motion and \\npreliminarily enjoined SMIC from disclosing fourteen 0.30 micron process steps. On October 3, 2008, \\nSMIC filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s August 8, 2008 Order with the California Court of Appeal. \\nThis appeal is currently pending. \\n \\n  - 4 -  \\n \\nDuring the pre-trial proceedings in the matter, as noted above under “Overview of TSMC Litigation”, \\nquestions arose regarding the actual terms of the 2005 Settlement Agreement between SMIC and \\nTSMC. Accordingly, the California Court held a preliminary trial on January 13 to 16, 2009, limited to a \\ndetermination of the terms of the Settlement Agreement and an interpretation of any requirements to \\n“meet and confer” prior to institution of litigation. On March 10, 2009, the Court issued a Statement of \\nDecision finding, in part, that an agreement between the parties was executed on January 30, 2005, \\nand thereafter amended on February 2, 2005, as urged by TSMC. The Company believes the Court’s \\nruling is erroneous. The ruling may be appealed by SMIC following the filing of a final judgment by the \\nCourt in this matter. \\n \\nOn May 1, 2009, the Company filed motions for summary adjudication against TSMC’s claims for \\nbreach of promissory notes and violation of the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The motions \\nwas heard by the Court on July 17, 2009.  On July 20, 2009, the Court denied the Company’s motions. \\n \\nThe California Court has further scheduled a trial upon all liability issues related to a selected list of \\nTSMC trade secret claims and SMIC trade secret claims to commence on September 8, 2009. \\n \\nIn the Company’s action in the Beijing High People’s Court, following an unsuccessful challenge to \\nthat Court’s jurisdiction by TSMC, the Court has held evidentiary hearings on October 15, October 29, \\nand November 25, 2008. The Court rendered its first-instance judgment on June 10, 2009. Claims of \\nSMIC against TSMC were not supported by the Court in the first-instance judgment. SMIC has \\nappealed the first-instance judgment to the PRC Supreme People’s Court.  \\n \\nUnder the provisions of SFAS 144, the Company is required to make a determination as to whether or \\nnot this pending litigation represents an event that requires a further analysis of whether the patent \\nlicense portfolio has been impaired. We believe that the lawsuit is at a discovery stage and we are still \\nevaluating whether or not the litigation represents such an event. The Company expects further \\ninformation to become available to us, which will aid us in making a determination. The outcome of \\nany impairment analysis performed under SFAS 144 might result in a material impact to our financial \\nposition and results of operations. Because the case is in its discovery stage, the Company is unable \\nto evaluate the likelihood of an unfavourable outcome or to estimate the amount or range of potential \\nloss. \\n  - 5 - '"
