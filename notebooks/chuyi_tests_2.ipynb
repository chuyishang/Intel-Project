Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (NYSE: \\nSMI; SEHK: 981) (“SMIC” or the “Company”), one of the leading semiconductor foundries in the world, \\ntoday announced its consolidated results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2012.   \\n \\nSecond Quarter 2012 Highlights:  \\n \\n(cid:1)  Record-high quarterly revenue of $421.8 million in 2Q12, which was up by 26.8% from \\n$332.7 million in 1Q12 and jumped by 19.7% year over year. \\n(cid:1)  Gross margin doubled to 24.1% in 2Q12 compared to 12.0% in 1Q12, primarily due to a \\nhigher utilization rate and continued improvements in manufacturing efficiency. \\n(cid:1)  Net cash flow from operations tripled to $109.4 million in 2Q12 from $35.8 million in \\n1Q12. \\n(cid:1)  Income attributable to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation was \\n$7.1 million in 2Q12, compared to a loss of $42.8 million in 1Q12. \\n(cid:1)  Diluted EPS was $0.01 per ADS. \\n \\n \\nThird Quarter 2012 Guidance:  \\n \\nThe following statements are forward looking statements which are based on current expectations \\nand which involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are set forth under “Safe Harbor \\nStatements” below. \\n \\n(cid:1)  Revenue is expected to increase between 4% and 6%. \\n(cid:1)  Gross margin is expected to range from 22% to 24%. \\n(cid:1)  Operating  expenses excluding foreign exchange  differences  and  government  grants  are \\nexpected to range from $93 million to $96 million. \\n \\n \\n \\nDr. Tzu-Yin Chiu, SMIC’s Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director, remarked, “I am very \\npleased to report solid second quarter results with revenue of US$421.8 million. This is a new sales \\nrecord for SMIC with a quarter-over-quarter increase of 26.8% and growth of 19.7% over the same \\nperiod last year.  We have a positive operating profit and a net profit of US$7.1 million. SMIC has \\nbenefited from strong customer demand across the board and in particular an 87% quarter-to-quarter \\nincrease in our 65/55nm revenue.  We are also experiencing a strong demand increase for our \\nspecialty processes, including power management ICs, EEPROM, and others.  As a result, the overall \\nrevenue growth exceeded our original guidance. \\n \\nWe are enjoying good overall fab utilization as a result of industry demand improvement and our \\ninternal efforts. The second quarter overall utilization was 95%, as compared to 74% in the first \\nquarter. \\n \\n- 1 – \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nOur China revenue continues to grow along with China’s semiconductor market. In the second quarter \\nof 2012, our China revenue grew 28% quarter-over-quarter, equivalent to about 33% of our total \\nrevenue in the second quarter of 2012.” \\n \\n  \\nConference Call / Webcast Announcement  \\n \\nDate: August 9, 2012 \\nTime: 8:30 a.m. Shanghai time \\nDial-in numbers and pass code:  \\n \\nUnited States          1-718-354-1231   (Pass code: SMIC) \\nHong Kong           852-2475-0994   (Pass code: SMIC) \\n \\nThe call will be webcast live with audio at http://www.smics.com/eng/investors/ir_presentations.php, or \\nat http://www.media-server.com/m/p/4w439mjh \\n \\nAn archived version of the webcast, along with an electronic copy of this news release will be \\navailable on the SMIC website for a period of 12 months following the webcast.  \\n \\n \\nAbout SMIC \\n \\nSemiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (“SMIC”; NYSE: SMI; SEHK: 981) is one of \\nthe leading semiconductor foundries in the world and the largest and most advanced foundry in \\nMainland China, providing integrated circuit (IC) foundry and technology services at 0.35-micron to \\n40-nanometer.
